          <p>Many perceive the stock market as inherently risky, particularly in the short term. While this holds true to some extent, it's crucial to understand that the level of risk varies depending on the investment horizon. In the short term, stock prices can fluctuate unpredictably due to various factors such as market sentiment, economic conditions, and geopolitical events. However, over the long term, historical data has shown that the stock market tends to provide favorable returns, making it less risky for investors with a longer investment horizon.

            <br/><br/>One significant indicator of the stock market's resilience is the performance of benchmark indices like the Sensex and Nifty. These indices have demonstrated remarkable growth since their inception, reflecting the underlying strength and growth potential of the Indian economy. Despite occasional downturns and market corrections, the overall trajectory of these indices has been upward, rewarding investors who remain invested for the long term.
            
            <br/><br/>It's essential to recognize that even during periods of market volatility, stock prices rarely plummet to zero. While individual stock prices may experience temporary declines, well-diversified portfolios and prudent investment strategies can mitigate the risk of substantial losses. Moreover, the stock market's ability to rebound from downturns underscores its resilience and potential to generate wealth over time. Thus, while the stock market may pose short-term risks, prudent investors who focus on the long-term fundamentals can navigate these challenges and benefit from the market's growth opportunities.</p>
