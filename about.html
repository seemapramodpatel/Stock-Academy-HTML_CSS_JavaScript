            <h4>Equity Investment</h4>
            <p>When you buy a share of a company you become a shareholder in
                that company. Shares are also known as Equities. Equities have the
                potential to increase in value over time. It also provides your
                portfolio with the growth necessary to reach your long term
                investment goals. Research studies have proved that the equities
                have outperformed most other forms of investments in the long
                term.
                • Equities are considered the most challenging and the rewarding,
                when compared to other investment options. <br>Research studies have proved that investments in some shares with
                a longer tenure of investment have yielded far superior returns
                than any other investment.
                • However, this does not mean all equity investments would
                guarantee similar high returns. Equities are high risk investments.
                One needs to study them carefully before investing </p>
